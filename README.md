## Project information

This scene has many different details and items. Some of them are the ones referenced in the specification of the project:
- 4 walls and a floor
- a table with 4 legs
- a cake with a candle
- a spotlight from the candle that is projected into the cake and table
- a car picture
- a spring
- a flower pot with a flower on it
- a journal
- a picture of the two elements of the group
- a window

We also added some other extra elements:
- a window with borders, a curtain, and the light projected from it
- a Kirby that casts a shadow :)
- a rug with a repeated texture that receives shadows (from the kirby and table)
- two spotlights above the  pictures of the elements of the group
- a border for the car picture
- both walls and floor with textures
- a door with a texture
- a circle that imitates a clock with its texture
- the cake has two halfs, in order to simulate a topping of some sort
- added 3 methods of interactive color change in the GUI (petals, cake topping and house walls)
- added 2 methods of object display and corresponding lights (window and candle)

There are some images below that show this scene final version. The reader can also checkout some prints that show part of this project's evolution in [here](tp1/screenshots/evolution/).

## Issues/Problems

There was a main issue during the development: during the parts where we had to update, for example, the wrapS value using the GUI, we weren't able to render the updated texture.
